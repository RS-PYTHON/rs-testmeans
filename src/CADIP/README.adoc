= CADIP server mockup docker image

== Description

This image may be used to start a container that simulates a CADIP server. There are 3 files hardcoded which
are to be sent in the search list and to be downloaded.

== Building

The docker image may be built with:

```bash
docker build --no-cache --progress=plain -t cadip-server-mockup .
```

== CLI Docker

The entrypoint of this  docker image is the cadip server mockup, which starts automatically and listens on port 5000. You can use the docker image to run a container as described in this simple example:

```bash
sudo docker run -ti --rm -p 5000:5000/tcp -p 5000:5000/udp cadip-server-mockup:<version>
```

where <version> may be void if the latest will be used.
After you start the container, you will be able to connect a client to it and request the list of files that can be downloaded.
